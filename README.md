**Currently Strong In**
- Python 3.x for scripting, automation, and CLI tools  
- Structuring projects cleanly and keeping code readable  
- Linux workflow, debugging, and real-world usage rather than tutorials  
- Iterating and improving instead of throwing projects away

## Featured Work

### Loghound  
Python-based Android Logcat filtering tool.

- Real-time filtering by severity, tag, and keyword  
- Cleaner and more readable output than raw logcat

## Earlier Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Pong](https://github.com/itsvictorvelma/Pong)** | Basic event-driven game logic and motion. |
| **[Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/itsvictorvelma/Turtle-Crossing)** | Movement systems, collision logic, and progression loops. |
| **[Snake](https://github.com/itsvictorvelma/snake-game)** | OOP design, game state handling, file storage for scoring. |

These were foundational. The focus now is practical software and tools.
